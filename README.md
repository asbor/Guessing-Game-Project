## Clarification for GitHub Pages Deployment

The assignment instructions require the GitHub Pages site to be generated from the README.md file, but GitHub Pages does not render README.md directly.
To satisfy this, an additional file called `index.md` was created as a copy of the generated README.md. This allows GitHub Pages to render the content properly.

This clarification ensures that the Pages site functions correctly while remaining faithful to the assignment's intent.
